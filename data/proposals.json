However, investors lack sufficient information about how the Company plans to address Scope 3 emissions, which constitute over 75% of Amazon's carbon footprint.\n\nScope 3 emissions from Amazon's vast supply chain present material risks including regulatory exposure, reputational damage, and potential stranded assets.
